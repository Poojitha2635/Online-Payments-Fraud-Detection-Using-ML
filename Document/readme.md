- Build a machine learning model to detect online payment fraud  
- Perform data preprocessing and feature engineering  
- Train and evaluate multiple ML algorithms  
- Compare model performance  
- Predict fraud on new/unseen transactions  


## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  
- Jupyter Notebook  


## 📊 Workflow

1. Data Collection  
2. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
4. Feature Selection  
5. Model Training
